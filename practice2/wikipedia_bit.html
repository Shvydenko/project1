    <p class="This1">This article is about the unit of information. For other uses, see Bit (disambiguation).</p>
</div>
<div>The <strong>bit</strong> is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a
    portmanteau of
    <strong>binary digit</strong>.[1] The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values
    are most commonly represented as either "1"or"0", but other representations such as
    <strong class="This1">true/false, yes/no, +/−, or on/off</strong> are common.
</div>
<br>
<div>The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of
    convention, and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program. It may be physically
    implemented with a two-state device.
</div>
<br>
<div>The symbol for the binary digit is either bit per recommendation by the IEC 80000-13:2008 standard, or the
    lowercase character b, as recommended by the IEEE 1541-2002 and IEEE Std 260.1-2004 standards.
</div>
<br>
<div>A contiguous group of binary digits is commonly called a bit string, a bit vector, or a single-dimensional (or
    multi-dimensional) bit array. A group of eight binary digits is called one byte, but historically the size of the
    byte is not strictly defined. Frequently, half, full, double and quadruple words consist of a number of bytes which
    is a low power of two.
</div>
<br>
<div>In information theory, one bit is the information entropy of a binary random variable that is 0 or 1 with equal
    probability,[2] or the information that is gained when the value of such a variable becomes known.[3][4] As a unit
    of information, the bit is also known as a shannon,[5] named after Claude E. Shannon.

<h2 class="History">History</h2>
<hr>
<div class="History_text">
    <div>The encoding of data by discrete bits was used in the punched cards invented by Basile Bouchon and
        Jean-Baptiste Falcon (1732), developed by Joseph Marie Jacquard (1804), and later adopted by Semyon Korsakov,
        Charles Babbage, Hermann Hollerith, and early computer manufacturers like IBM. Another variant of that idea was
        the perforated paper tape. In all those systems, the medium (card or tape) conceptually carried an array of hole
        positions; each position could be either punched through or not, thus carrying one bit of information. The
        encoding of text by bits was also used in Morse code (1844) and early digital communications machines such as
        teletypes and stock ticker machines (1870).
    </div>
    <br>
    <div>Ralph Hartley suggested the use of a logarithmic measure of information in 1928.[6] Claude E. Shannon first
        used the word "bit" in his seminal 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication".[7][8][9] He attributed
        its origin to John W. Tukey, who had written a Bell Labs memo on 9 January 1947 in which he contracted "binary
        information digit" to simply "bit".[7] Vannevar Bush had written in 1936 of "bits of information" that could be
        stored on the punched cards used in the mechanical computers of that time.[10] The first programmable computer,
        built by Konrad Zuse, used binary notation for numbers.

<h2 class="History">Physical Representation</h2>
<hr>
<div>A bit can be stored by a digital device or other physical system that exists in either of two possible distinct
    states. These may be the two stable states of a flip-flop, two positions of an electrical switch, two distinct
    voltage or current levels allowed by a circuit, two distinct levels of light intensity, two directions of
    magnetization or polarization, the orientation of reversible double stranded DNA, etc.
</div>
<br>
<div>Bits can be implemented in several forms. In most modern computing devices, a bit is usually represented by an
    electrical voltage or current pulse, or by the electrical state of a flip-flop circuit.
</div>
<br>
<div>For devices using positive logic, a digit value of 1 (or a logical value of true) is represented by a more positive
    voltage relative to the representation of 0. The specific voltages are different for different logic families and
    variations are permitted to allow for component aging and noise immunity. For example, in transistor–transistor
    logic (TTL) and compatible circuits, digit values 0 and 1 at the output of a device are represented by no higher
    than 0.4 volts and no lower than 2.6 volts, respectively; while TTL inputs are specified to recognize 0.8 volts or
    below as 0 and 2.2 volts or above as 1.
</div>
<br>
<h4 class="Transmission"><strong>Transmission and processing</strong></h4>
<br>
<div>Bits are transmitted one at a time in serial transmission, and by a multiple number of bits in parallel
    transmission. A bitwise operation optionally processes bits one at a time. Data transfer rates are usually measured
    in decimal SI multiples of the unit bit per second (bit/s), such as kbit/s.

<h2 class="Information">Multiple bits</h2>
<hr>
<div class="Multiple">
    <p><img src="photo/Снимок.PNG" alt="">Multiple bits may be expressed and represented in several ways. For
        convenience of representing commonly
        reoccurring groups of bits in information technology, several units of information have traditionally been used.
        The most common is the unit byte, coined by Werner Buchholz in June 1956, which historically was used to
        represent the group of bits used to encode a single character of text (until UTF-8 multibyte encoding took over)
        in a computer[12][13][14][15][16] and for this reason it was used as the basic addressable element in many
        computer architectures. The trend in hardware design converged on the most common implementation of using eight
        bits per byte, as it is widely used today. However, because of the ambiguity of relying on the underlying
        hardware design, the unit octet was defined to explicitly denote a sequence of eight bits.
        Computers usually manipulate bits in groups of a fixed size, conventionally named "words". Like the byte, the
        number of bits in a word also varies with the hardware design, and is typically between 8 and 80 bits, or even
        more in some specialized computers. In the 21st century, retail personal or server computers have a word size of
        32 or 64 bits.

        The International System of Units defines a series of decimal prefixes for multiples of standardized units which
        are commonly also used with the bit and the byte. The prefixes kilo (103) through yotta (1024) increment by
        multiples of 1000, and the corresponding units are the kilobit (kbit) through the yottabit (Ybit).</p>
